Assignment: Name, Age, and Annual Income                                                                                                                                          

  Write a program that declares the following:                                               
  
  • a String variable named name                                                              
  • an int variable named age                                                                 
  • a double variable named annualPay                                                         
                                                                                            
Store your age, name, and desired annual income as literals in these variables. The program 
should display these values on the screen in a manner similar to the following:             
My name is Joe Mahoney, my age is 26, and I hope to earn $100000.0 per year.
